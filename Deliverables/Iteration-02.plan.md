-Priority tasks are generally distibuted across members based on amount of work we estimate.

#### Git / GitHub workflow

Our workflow consists largely of several development branches and master. When people want to merge changes into master they rebase onto it and then make a pull request. As master evolves rebases are required by all members of the team in order to stay up to date with master.

Once a pull request is submitted it *usually* needs at least one review (unless it is a hotfix) for code style etc. once changes have been made the request can be merged into master. We also intend to incorporate some autotesting which will also be a barrier for merging code once we have more substantial functionality implemented.

This workflow is good for a number of reasons; frequent rebases encourage everyone to keep their code synced up and discourages big changes, it also leads to a *generally* cleaner and more linear master than otherwise. It was also the policy at some team members employers in the past.
