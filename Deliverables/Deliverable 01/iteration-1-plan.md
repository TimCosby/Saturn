# S@urn

## Iteration 1

 * Start date: September 24, 2018
 * End date: October 12, 2018

## Process


#### Roles & responsibilities


Backend: Backend implementation, including Database, server, scraping webpages, API for front end, etc

- Tim, Tiffany, Reece, Khori

Frontend: Frontend implementation, including UI/UX design, using backend API for features

- Ellen, Ray

QA/Devops: Testing, processes

- Khori, Reece


#### Events

- Scrum meeting: tutorial time (planning & review), 
- Progress review: make sure the progress of project is according to plan, resolve any conflicts that are hindering progress
- Code review: examine pull requests and decide whether to merge them to master
- Merge conflict session (between members who submitted conflicting code): resolve the merge conflict (should be short and possibly online)
- Weekly: state specific, short term goals for upcoming week
- Short meeting: short discussions online for tickets, short discussions


#### Artifacts

- Weekly to-do tasks per member: each member will know exact what to do for the week (could have colouring scheme to notify which tasks are done, each tasks should have priority number)
- Issue tracking with Github Issues: Kanban board with epics and stories for each feature
- Scrum master keeps track of the teams progress every sprint
- Epics & stories written before beginning work on any feature, everyone picks what they want to work on, & work on them during the sprint


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

- Define our product in a detailed manner
	- Determine MVP
	- Identify additional features to include
	- To do: finish product.md
- Define role/responsibilities of each member (backend, frontend, QA/Devops)
- Complete product.md, iteration-1 plan, iteration-1 review
- Determine implementation details
- The method for scraping necessary data
	- To do: research efficient web scraping techniques, APIs that are available 
- Research which APIs are available, which database
- Figure out if we should use a server
- Produce artifacts: UML, Mockup, Logo, video, epics & stories (details underneath)


#### Artifacts

- UML (defining classes/relationship for mainly backend): for better understanding when coding for backend, easier distribution of tasks between members (one member per class for example)
- Mockup of different pages of the app: front end will have a specific end goal to follow
- Logo: the essence of our product is embedded in the logo
- Video(2 - 3 minutes): a fun way to introduce our product to potential customers
	- Includes: functional overview of our product, features, how it appeals to target audiences, how problem our product solves
- Epics & stories
	- Used to create issues on Github since it has all the required classes/methods
