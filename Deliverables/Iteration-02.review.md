 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 29
 * Where: Bahen Centre 

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 
 - Decided to move away from having individual development branches towards having feature/time-relevant branches which means that we spend less time rebasing all our old branches. This has been successful because we've spent less time rebasing and dealing with keeping old branches up to date.
 - Tried to increase the amount of Code Review that has been happening on Front End and Back End with some good success. This was successful because reviewed code less frequently has issues and has kept our master branch more stable than in our prior iteration.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
 
- Wanted to move entire conversation to Slack which improved our ability to plan and communicate across our team. This was unsuccessful because the move has not happened largely in order to avoid fragmenting our communiction across multiple mediums.
- Was less successful that we would have liked in terms of keeping out tickets/Github Issues up to date which at times has made it difficult to track progress.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.
 
 - Will move towards ore individual communication to mitigate the disadvantages of our current communication platofrm and the tendency for large groups to become full of spam making it hard for the team to keep up.
 - Will start the Sprint by updating all of our issues and tickets and will do our best to keep these up to date throughout the spint.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
- 1) Reach MVP - Very close with controllers underway and database being finalized.
- 2) UI coming along - Large pages are done and ready to be connected with the backend via. controllers.
- 3) Significant increase in number of tests - Have added about 10 more tests during this Sprint. With more planned by the D2 due date.


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

- 1) Database working and being fed by scrapers - Final modifications to Schema are underway.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
 
 - Need to continue work to improve our communication. Many online messages were ignored/unread by members since we have conversations without all the members present. This is a problem for some important details are not delivered to all members of the group.
 - Need to continue work to keep tickets etc. updated. We completed tickets but did not remove them from GitHub which led to confused congress and accuracy of the team's current position.
 - The group is working well and nobody is really slacking, everyone has been able to complete their tickets which is good.
