# S@urn

## Iteration 1

 * When: 12/10/2018
 * Where: BA 3200

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

- Creating the UML before writing the epic stories/git issues allowing us to have streamline what each method would do and how they would interact with each other
- Once we realized that since we didn’t have specific roles - not everyone knew exactly what to do
  - We quickly decided to assign roles (front/back end, …, etc) to team up into small groups and discuss implementation details for the project

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped


- Before our roles were defined, not everyone knew what to contribute/work on - lead to confusion
- Didn’t initially have a common Google Drive for the project (pre-repo) this led to highly fragmented project documentation which made collaboration difficult (creation of this allowed for everyone to return to the same page).

#### Planned changes
- More digital communication (use Slack more!) so we don’t need to meet in person as often
 - Everyone's schedule is not the same - online is easier to origanize 
 - Digital communication provides documentation (from chat)
- More organized communication (Slack) - using Facebook is too messy
 - Facebook does not have categories/organization like Slack

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

- Three required documents: iteration-1 plan/ iteration-1 review/product.md
- UML
- Prototype mockup
- Created github issues for classes/methods
#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

- Everything planned was completed

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

- Need to continue to refine our organizational structure to streamline decision making and quickly find a consensus, this will keep development moving across the board. We also need to find better collaboration methods that don’t require meeting up (perhaps trying to move back towards Slack)

- Need to prioritize issues such that we can start some basic QA of main classes and to prevent not having parent classes before children. 


- Need to figure out how to maximize each person's autonomy while still working towards common goals.
