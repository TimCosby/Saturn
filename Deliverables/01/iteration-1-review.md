 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 1

 * When: 12/10/2018
 * Where: BA 3200

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


Creating the UML before writing the epic stories/git issues allowing us to have streamline what each method would do and how they would interact with each other.
Once we realized that since we didn’t have specific roles - not everyone knew exactly what to do
We quickly decided to assign roles (front/back end, …, etc) to team up into small groups and discuss implementation details for the project

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped


- Before our roles were defined, not everyone knew what to contribute/work on - lead to confusion
- Didn’t initially have a common Google Drive for the project (pre-repo) this led to highly fragmented project documentation which made collaboration difficult (creation of this allowed for everyone to return to the same page).

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.
- More digital communication (use Slack more!) so we don’t need to meet in person as often
- More organized communication (Slack) - using Facebook is too messy

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
- Three required documents: iteration-1 plan/ iteration-1 review/product.md
- UML
- Prototype mockup
- Created github issues for classes/methods
#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

- Everything planned was completed
## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.

Need to continue to refine our organizational structure to streamline decision making and quickly find a consensus, this will keep development moving across the board. We also need to find better collaboration methods that don’t require meeting up (perhaps trying to move back towards Slack)

Need to prioritize issues such that we can start some basic QA of main classes and to prevent not having parent classes before children. 


Need to figure out how to maximize each person's autonomy while still working towards common goals.
